## Description

Ferro is a **complete, production-ready** cross-platform Windows ISO downloader written in Rust - a full 1:1 rewrite of the popular [Fido PowerShell script](https://github.com/pbatard/Fido) by Pete Batard. Ferro provides a modern CLI interface for downloading official Microsoft Windows retail ISOs and UEFI Shell images without requiring PowerShell or Windows.

**✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED**: Ferro is now feature-complete with exact API replication of Fido's behavior.

This tool exists because, while Microsoft does make retail ISO download links freely and publicly available (at least for Windows 8 through Windows 11), these links were historically only available after forcing users to jump through many unwarranted hoops that created an exceedingly counterproductive consumer experience.

### Why Retail ISOs?

Using official retail ISOs is currently the only way to assert with absolute certainty that the OS content has not been altered. Because there exists only a single master for each retail ISO, Microsoft retail ISOs are the only ones you can obtain an official SHA-1 for (from MSDN or sites like [msdn.rg-adguard.net](https://msdn.rg-adguard.net/public.php)), allowing you to be 100% sure that the image you are using has not been corrupted and is safe to use.

Unlike Microsoft's Media Creation Tool (MCT), which generates ISOs on-the-fly (making each one unique), retail ISOs provide verifiable, bit-for-bit identical content that matches Microsoft's original release.

## ✅ Key Features

- **✅ Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux without PowerShell dependency
- **✅ Official ISOs**: Downloads genuine Microsoft Windows retail ISOs with verifiable checksums  
- **✅ Multiple Versions**: Supports Windows 11, Windows 10, and UEFI Shell images
- **✅ Modern CLI**: Clean command-line interface with helpful error messages
- **✅ Smart Defaults**: Automatically selects appropriate language and architecture based on system
- **✅ Progress Tracking**: Real-time download progress with speed and ETA information
- **✅ URL-Only Mode**: Option to retrieve download URLs without downloading
- **✅ Session Management**: Proper Microsoft API integration with anti-ban measures
- **✅ 1:1 Fido Accuracy**: Exact replication of Fido's behavior and API calls

## Technical Details

Ferro replicates the functionality of the original Fido PowerShell script by:

1. **Session Management**: Creates authenticated sessions with Microsoft's download servers
2. **API Communication**: Uses Microsoft's software-download-connector API endpoints
3. **Multi-step Process**: Follows the same version → release → edition → language → architecture → download workflow
4. **Anti-automation Handling**: Implements session whitelisting and proper request headers
5. **Cross-platform Compatibility**: Pure Rust implementation works on any platform Rust supports

### Architecture

- `src/main.rs`: CLI entry point and command coordination
- `src/cli.rs`: Command-line argument parsing and validation  
- `src/iso_api.rs`: Microsoft API communication and session management
- `src/downloader.rs`: HTTP download implementation with progress tracking
- `src/types.rs`: Data structures for API responses and internal state
- `src/utils.rs`: Cross-platform utilities for locale/architecture detection

## Comparison with Fido

| Feature | Fido (PowerShell) | Ferro (Rust) |
|---------|-------------------|--------------|
| Platform Support | Windows only | Windows, macOS, Linux |
| Dependencies | PowerShell 3.0+ | None (single binary) |
| Performance | Interpreted | Compiled (faster) |
| Memory Usage | Higher (PowerShell runtime) | Lower (native binary) |
| Distribution | Script file | Single executable |
| GUI Mode | Yes | CLI only (for now) |

## ✅ Implementation Status

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Q: I'm getting a 715-123130 error**  
A: This is a temporary IP ban from Microsoft due to too many requests. Wait 1-24 hours and try again. This is normal behavior when testing multiple downloads.

**Q: Download is slow**  
A: Download speed depends on your internet connection and Microsoft's servers. Ferro shows progress bars to track download status.

**Q: Invalid architecture error**  
A: Make sure you're using the correct architecture name: "x64", "x86", or "ARM64" (case-sensitive).

### Debug Mode

For troubleshooting, run with debug logging:
```bash
RUST_LOG=debug ferro download --version "Windows 11"
```

## Acknowledgments

Ferro is inspired by and based on the excellent [Fido PowerShell script](https://github.com/pbatard/Fido) by Pete Batard. This Rust implementation aims to provide the same functionality in a cross-platform, dependency-free package.

The original Fido documentation and README can be found in the `/README/` directory of this repository for reference.

## Additional Notes

Because of its intended usage similar to Fido, this tool is not designed to cover every possible retail ISO download. Instead, we focus on the downloads that the general public is likely to request. We currently have no plans to add support for LTSB/LTSC Windows ISO downloads.

If you are interested in such downloads, please visit the relevant download pages from Microsoft such as [this one](https://www.microsoft.com/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-10-enterprise) for LTSC versions.
